     * The Apache Fineract Batch API is also capable of executing all the requests in a single transaction, by setting a Query Parameter, \&quot;enclosingTransaction&#x3D;true\&quot;. So, if one or more of the requests in a batch returns an erroneous response all of the Data base transactions made by other successful requests will be rolled back.  If there has been a rollback in a transaction then a single response will be provided, with a &#39;400&#39; status code and a body consisting of the error details of the first failed request.
