 * Apache Fineract API Documentation
 * Apache Fineract is a secure, multi-tenanted microfinance platform. <br />              The goal of the Apache Fineract API is to empower developers to build apps on top of the Apache Fineract Platform. The reference app [  https://demo.openmf.org  ] (username: mifos, password: password) works on the same demo tenant as the interactive links in this documentation.              <br/>The API                 is organized around REST [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer ]               <br/> Find out more about Apache Fineract on [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm#top ]              <br/> You can Try The API From Your Browser itself at [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm#interact ]              <br/> The Generic Options are available at [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm#genopts ]              <br/> Find out more about Updating Dates and Numbers at [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm#dates_and_numbers ]              <br/> For the Authentication and the Basic of HTTP and HTTPS refer [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm#authentication_overview ]              <br/> Check about ERROR codes at [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm#errors ]               <br/> <br/> Please refer to the old documentation for any documentation queries [ https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm ]              <br/>             ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Mandatory Fields: rejectionDate, rejectionReasonId  Withdraw a Client:  Client applications can be withdrawn when client is in a pending for activation status.  If the client is any other status, this API throws an error.  Mandatory Fields: withdrawalDate, withdrawalReasonId  Reactivate a Client: Clients can be reactivated after they have been closed.  Trying to reactivate a client in any other state throws an error.  Mandatory Fields: reactivationDate  UndoReject a Client:  Clients can be reactivated after they have been rejected.  Trying to reactivate a client in any other state throws an error.  Mandatory Fields: reopenedDateUndoWithdraw a Client:  Clients can be reactivated after they have been withdrawn.  Trying to reactivate a client in any other state throws an error.  Mandatory Fields: reopenedDate  Assign a Staff:  Allows you to assign a Staff for existed Client.
